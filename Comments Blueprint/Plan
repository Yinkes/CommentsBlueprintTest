okay so basically what we need to do is get all the ids of elements that matter write down what type of element it is and what or what type of elements will work 
with it 
then we take the files and we put them in organized folders so that the blueprint can be dropped into the file directory then all we need to worry about is 
html but we know what elements that we need
